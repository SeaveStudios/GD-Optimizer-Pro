# GD Optimizer Pro 

GD Optimizer Pro is a fork of xanii's GD Optimizer that aims to update regularly with each update adding new optimizations. This program prioritizes certain processes on low and Geometry Dash on high. If you want to add more processes to be prioritized, check out the source code! It's important to note that modifying the priority of processes on a computer can potentially have unintended consequences, so use caution when using this tool.



## How To Use

To use GD Optimizer Pro, download the executable and run it. Then, open Geometry Dash and run the optimization button. You can also click the other buttons for a quick boost.
